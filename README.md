# Advent of code 2022

It is a mix of [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) and programming puzzles - similar to those that you can find on interviews or sites like [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) but with nice Christmas plot. Starting from first December, each day new puzzle is released. In order to get the star ‚≠ê one need to provide a correct answer for given input which is provided in file. After that the second part of the problem is unblocked which is some kind of variation which relates to the first part (most often it makes the problem harder). Advent Of Code ends on 25th December, so there is possibilty of collecting 50 stars - 2 per day.

There is a [super cool talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS9882S0ZHs) given by Eric Wastl - an author of Advent of Code who explain what I wrote above in details and tell what happens ‚Äòbehind the scene‚Äô.

# Goal

This year I want to brush up my JavaScript skills. It's been a while when I was using it, so maybe it's worth to check out how do I feel with that ;) I think that also it may give me some time advantages - I will save the compilation time so I can be a bit faster - which can give me some more points in leaderboard.

# Last year attempt
Last year I solved all the problems with Kotlin and Spock with Groovy served me for test purposes. I also focused last time on TDD.
